These represents the various "stages" of the application, from Chapter 01 to Chapter 10.

Each project can be opened independently using the included OpenGameList_ChapterXX.sln file, 
or they can be opened alltogheter within a single solution using the OpenGameList.sln file.

Some chapters (3 and 5) have two projects each, splitted into Part 1 and Part 2, because they both contain a huge code refactoring.
